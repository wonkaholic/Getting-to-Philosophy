# Getting-to-Philosophy

During this challenge, I've tried to find the code that would help me to understand how to write the right algorithm.

However, I couldn't write the right code, because I am still a beginner, and I realize that I need to read more to write the right algorithm.

The code I posted is the version I could understand the most, and I've been trying to write my own but I couldn't get it to work.
